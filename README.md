This enables companions to get haircuts in Diamond City and Vault 81, and surgery at Mega Surgery Center. Simply pay, then instruct your companion to sit in the chair.

Companions can also use buildable barber and surgery chairs from other mods.

Works with Humans, Ghouls, and Gen-3 Synths.

I recommend that you save first.

### Known Issues

* After editing Curie, she may turn invisible, or her hair may glitch. I've included a script that will attempt to fix this on the next save and reload.
* Editing ghouls is apparently limited to hair and body. No face options are available.
* Doesn't work with the chairs from Vault-Tec Workshop.
